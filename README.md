# _Places You've Been_

#### _Epicodus Student Project: Object & Constructors practice, June 13, 2016_

#### By _**Marty Fitchen, Colin W Kingen, Epicodus**_

## Description

_This is an Epicodus student project creating a web page that uses front-end user interface logic to gather input (in this case information about a place the user has been to) and convert it to a list (using back-end logic). Using Behavior Driven Development (BDD) this list will establish true and false booleans based on expected outputs based on potential user inputs using just the right amount of clean code. See spec below:_

Behavior  | Input Example | Output Example
------------- | ------------- | -------------
Gather user input from a form (i.e., Place Name). | 2 | 2
Output is stored in a unique Object. | 3 | Object: 3
Additional input is appended to a list. | 5,1 | Object: 5, Object: 1
Only last-clicked unique Object in list will display the content. | 15 | Attribute: 1, Attribute: 2, Attribute: 3
